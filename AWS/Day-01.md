Introduction to Virtualization and Cloud Computing
Topics Covered
1. Introduction to Virtualization
What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of hardware, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
Types of Virtualization
Server Virtualization: Multiple virtual servers on one physical machine.
Storage Virtualization: Combining multiple physical storage devices into a single virtual unit.
Network Virtualization: Abstracting network resources into a manageable virtual framework.
Key Benefits:
Efficient resource utilization
Cost savings
Scalability
Simplified management
Deep Dive Knowledge:
Virtualization uses a hypervisor (like VMware or VirtualBox) to manage VMs.
Popular tools include KVM, Xen, and Microsoft Hyper-V.
Real-time Example: A company can run a legacy Windows app on a Linux server using virtualization.
Simple Explanation:
Think of virtualization as renting rooms in a house (the physical machine) where each room (VM) has its own tenant (OS).
2. Virtualization vs Cloud
Virtualization is a foundational technology; cloud computing builds on it.
Comparison Table:
Feature
Virtualization
Cloud Computing
Definition
Technology to create virtual environments.
Delivery of on-demand computing resources via the internet.
Deployment
Local (on-premises servers).
Hosted on the internet.
Scalability
Limited by physical hardware.
Highly scalable without physical limits.
Access
Internal network only.
Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

Deep Dive Knowledge:
Virtualization focuses on optimizing hardware usage, while cloud emphasizes service delivery and flexibility.
Real-time Example: Virtualization is like owning apartments in a building, whereas cloud is like Airbnb where anyone can rent as needed.
3. Cloud Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
Virtualized hardware resources.
Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
Real-time Example: Hosting a website on AWS EC2 where you control the OS and applications.
Platform as a Service (PaaS):
Platforms for application development.
Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.
Real-time Example: Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy a web app without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
Software as a Service (SaaS):
Software accessible over the internet.
Examples: Gmail, Salesforce.
Real-time Example: Using Google Docs to collaborate on documents in real-time.
Simple Explanation:
IaaS: Like renting a raw apartment and furnishing it yourself.
PaaS: Like renting a fully furnished apartment but adding your own decorations.
SaaS: Like booking a hotel room where everything is ready.
4. AWS Account Creation
Follow these steps to create your AWS account:
Visit AWS Free Tier.
Sign Up:
Enter your email address and password.
Create an account name.
Account Type: Choose "Personal" or "Professional."
Payment Method: Add a valid credit/debit card for identity verification.
Verify Identity: Enter your mobile number for OTP verification.
Select Support Plan: Choose "Basic (Free)."
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Deep Dive Knowledge:
AWS Free Tier offers 12 months of free services like EC2, S3, and Lambda with usage limits.
Real-time Example: Use the free tier to deploy a simple static website using S3 and monitor costs via the AWS Billing Dashboard.

Basic Networking in Linux
Overview of Networking Fundamentals
Networking is the process of connecting computers and devices to share resources and communicate.
Key Concepts:
IP Address: Identifies devices on a network.
Subnet Mask: Divides an IP address into network and host parts.
Gateway: Routes traffic between networks.
DNS (Domain Name System): Resolves domain names to IP addresses.

IP Address
Explanation:
Every device needs a unique number to communicate. This is called an IP address.
 Demo
ip addr


Subnet Mask
Explanation:
Subnet mask tells which part is network and which part is device.
 Demo
ip addr show



Gateway
Explanation:
Gateway is the exit door to the internet.
 Demo
ip route

DNS
Explanation:
Humans remember names (google.com), computers understand IPs.
 Demo
nslookup google.com
OR
dig google.com
Explain:
Domain name → IP address











OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols.
Layers:
Physical Layer: Hardware components like cables and switches.
Data Link Layer: Responsible for error detection and framing (e.g., Ethernet).
Network Layer: Handles routing and IP addressing (e.g., IP protocol).
Transport Layer: Ensures reliable communication (e.g., TCP, UDP).
Session Layer: Manages sessions between applications.
Presentation Layer: Formats data (e.g., encryption, compression).
Application Layer: Interfaces with applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

Network Types
LAN (Local Area Network):
Covers a small geographic area, such as an office.
High speed and low latency.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):
Covers a city or metropolitan area.
Typically used for city-wide connectivity.
WAN (Wide Area Network):
Covers large geographic areas, such as countries or continents.
Examples include the internet.

Types of IPs
Static IP:
Permanently assigned to a device.
Commonly used for servers and network devices.


Public IP:
Exposed to the internet.
Unique across the globe.
Private IP:
Used within private networks.
Cannot be accessed directly from the internet.

Basic Networking Commands
ping 0.0.0.0 - to check internet connectivity
dig - to check domain
curl - to download files from internet and data transfer
wget - to download files
ifconfig - to check ip address
ip addr - to check ip address
nslookup -
netstat


🔹 ping – Connectivity Test
Explain
“ping checks if the other system is alive.”
Demo
ping google.com


ping 8.8.8.8




dig – DNS Lookup
dig google.com


 curl – Data Transfer
curl https://example.com

curl -O https://example.com

🔹 wget – Download Files
wget https://example.com


🔹 ifconfig (Old command)
ifconfig

Explain:
Older tool


Shows IP, MAC

 ip addr (Modern command)
ip addr


🔹 nslookup
nslookup google.com

Explain:
Name → IP


DNS troubleshooting


systemctl (Service Management)
Explain
“systemctl controls services like start, stop, restart.”
Demo
systemctl status ssh

Start service:
sudo systemctl start ssh

Stop service:
sudo systemctl stop ssh


7️⃣ journalctl (Logs)
Explain
“journalctl shows system logs.”
Demo
journalctl -n 10

Service logs:
journalctl -u ssh

Live logs:
journalctl -f

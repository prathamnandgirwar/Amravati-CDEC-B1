# ☁ Why AWS Stands Out in the Cloud Market

- Market leader with a broad range of services  
- Exceptional scalability and reliability  
- Comprehensive global infrastructure  

---

## 🏆 Why AWS is #1

- First cloud provider  
- Largest market share  
- Trusted by startups & enterprises  

---

## 🔎 Key Reasons

- Global infrastructure  
- Pay-as-you-go model  
- Highly secure  
- Huge service ecosystem  

---

## 📦 Overview of AWS

- Provides compute, storage, networking, and database services  
- Popular services: EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda  
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model  

💡 Instead of buying a ₹5 lakh server, you rent a server for ₹10/hour.

# 🌟 Customer Success Stories

### 🎬 Netflix
Scalable streaming platform  

### 🚀 NASA
Data storage and processing  

---

## ❗ Problem Netflix Faced

- Millions of users  
- Different countries  
- Peak traffic at night & weekends  
- Traditional servers cannot scale fast  

### Example:
On Friday night at 9 PM, suddenly 1 million people press PLAY 😳  
If servers are limited → app crashes.

## ✅ How AWS Helped Netflix

Netflix moved fully to AWS:

- EC2 → Run streaming services  
- S3 → Store video content  
- Auto Scaling → Add servers automatically  
- CloudFront → Fast video delivery worldwide  

---

## 🔄 What Happens in Real Time

1. User clicks Play  
2. AWS checks nearest server  
3. Video streams from closest location  
4. If traffic increases → AWS adds more servers  

---

## 💡 Key Learning for Students

AWS allows automatic scaling without manual work.

👉 **What would happen if Netflix used only 5 physical servers?**
